#Data Ingestion
Twitter Data Fetching: Use Tweepy (or another Twitter API wrapper) to stream or batch-fetch tweets. Consider using streaming APIs if real-time processing is desired or REST endpoints for periodic pulls.

RabbitMQ - Message Broker for Flow of the twitter data.

#Data Cleaning Module:
Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags (or treat them as features if useful).
Normalize text (lowercase, remove emojis or convert them to text if useful).
Handle language detection and translation if you’re dealing with multilingual data.

Text Preprocessing:
Tokenization, stop-word removal, and possibly lemmatization/stemming.
Use libraries like spaCy or NLTK for these tasks.

#NLP Pipeline
Sentiment Analysis:
Identify posts with sentiments (potential alarm signals) using sentiment analysis models.
Pre-trained sentiment classifiers (open source like VADER, TextBlob, or models from Hugging Face) can be used.
Disaster-Relevance Filtering:
Develop a classifier to decide if a tweet is disaster-related. You can start with keyword-based filtering (e.g., “earthquake”, “flood”, “fire”) and then fine-tune an open source model.
Consider fine-tuning an open source transformer model (e.g., DistilBERT, RoBERTa) on a labeled disaster dataset.
Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Information Extraction:
Extract locations, event details, and other relevant entities using spaCy, Hugging Face pipelines, or open source NER models.
For geolocation extraction, look for explicit coordinate mentions (latitude/longitude) and textual location names.
Context Extraction using LLMs:
For deeper understanding, you can pass the cleaned tweet text to open source LLMs (e.g., BLOOM, GPT-J, LLaMA) that are fine-tuned for information extraction.
Use a prompt-based approach where the model is asked to extract specific details such as disaster type, location, severity, etc.
Consider the trade-offs: LLMs provide more contextual extraction but can be more resource-intensive.

#Data Storage and Dashboard Integration
Database:
Store the raw tweets, metadata, and extracted information in a database. You might use a relational database (like PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL option (like MongoDB) depending on the schema flexibility you need.
Admin Dashboard:
Develop an admin interface (could be a web app using frameworks like Django, Flask, or Node.js) that queries the database and displays the shortlisted disaster-related tweets along with their extracted metadata.
Implement filtering, search, and visualization (maps for location coordinates, timelines, etc.).

#Query Optimization
Adjust Query Parameters:
Depending on your query and Twitter API endpoints (e.g., search vs. streaming), adjust parameters to minimize the retrieval of duplicates. For example, using since_id or max_id parameters helps you fetch only new tweets since your last query.

Time Window Management:
If you’re running repeated queries, maintain the timestamp or tweet ID of the last processed tweet. Then, modify the query to fetch tweets that are newer than that reference point.
