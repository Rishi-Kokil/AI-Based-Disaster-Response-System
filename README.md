# AI-Based Disaster Response System

This project aims to develop a coordinated disaster response system by integrating data from social media platforms such as X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram, satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine, and real-time climate data. The system will use AI to analyze this data and predict the most affected areas, allowing for a focused, efficient rescue operation. It also involves developing a centralized mobile and web application that provides an overview of all the gathered data and locations, helping to generate a coordinated response for disaster management teams.
