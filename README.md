# AI-Based Disaster Response System

This project aims to develop a coordinated disaster response system by integrating data from various sources such as:

- Social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram
- Satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine
- Real-time climate data

The system leverages AI to analyze this data, predict the most affected areas, and assist in orchestrating efficient rescue operations. It also includes the development of a centralized mobile and web application that consolidates all the gathered data and locations, aiding disaster management teams in generating a coordinated response.
